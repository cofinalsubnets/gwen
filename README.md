## how make
are you on linux? `make` will probably work. otherwise, see
`Makefile` for the suggested compiler flags.

## how use
- false/nil/none is just 0
- all functions are curried
- data are own constant functions
- singleton list is `quote`
- `(\ arg1 arg2 arg3 exp)` is `lambda`
- `(? test1 exp1 test2 exp2 test3 exp3)` is `cond`
