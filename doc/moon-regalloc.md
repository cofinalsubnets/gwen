# moon-regalloc — the register story, and the catalog of the gap

How mooncc decides what lives in a register, what that costs against gcc/clang -O2, and
which levers remain — the **catalog** the differentials built, promoted from session
memory 2026-08-10. Companions: doc/moon-diff.md (the running three-compiler ledger),
doc/moon-c-gaps.md (conformance), doc/moon-diag.md (refusals). Anchors below are into
crew/moon/gen.l; verify before leaning on one — this file states shape and physics, the
code states truth.

## the register story as it stands

The generator's baseline is an accumulator protocol: every expression computes into r0
and carries its type; locals ride the r4 frame. On top of that, residency, in layers —
each one priced, gated, and landed separately:

* **the operand pool** (`opool`, six caller-saved regs) — statement-scoped staging;
  `ralloc`/`rfree`, reset at every statement. A pool value never crosses a call.
* **the vmap** — the cross-statement leg: a universe local's value, once written through
  a pool register, maps name → reg so re-reads are zero forms. Write-through: the slot
  stays the single source of truth, so a flush forgets, never spills. Flushes at every
  label and call emission; if/?: join labels survive by pair-INTERSECTION over arriving
  edges (the forward-JOIN meet).
* **homes and rides** — a param's positional seat (`homefold`), the self-assign ride
  license (a param whose only arrival-defs are self-updates rides its arrival register
  end-to-end), int/uint locals and params admitted under canonical extension (`lhomable?`,
  every def re-narrows via cvt so the home always holds the extended value).
* **the cs pool** (IR r11-r14 → machine r12-r15) — callee-saved homes that ride through
  calls unwrapped, priced by the depth≥2/tc≥3 in-loop license; d128 locals take PAIR
  seats (`'regw`). The whole grant is minted at one door: `seats` answers `(lh ih lp cs)`.
* **splice binds** — cbinl/cginl alias a pinned/homed caller register into an inlinee
  (`alsafe?` the staging law), park or seat other args only when priced (`paid?`:
  loop-weighted reads ≥ 8; `deep?`: two pool seats remain after the take; regen attempts
  only — the `rgon` gate).
* **recovery passes** — addrfold (address arith into addressing modes, ldx/stx/si),
  deadcell (the spush-cell reservation sweep), stld/stldw (store-load residency),
  dehusk (mov husks: feed/back/dup/self, the rename sandwich, quiet-window back-copy),
  cmpfuse (`dieb?`, the branching death proof), unframe + jr0/unhome (frame elision and
  home→arrival renames), laylax (branch relaxation, in holo).
* **the armor** — cskeep (the callee-saved contract checked at emission, path-aware,
  dark ops refused), stage.l's typed pipeline sigs, the g-pin record (`fnreset`). A
  homing rung is gated by construction now; disassembly probes are for perf reads.

What there is NOT: liveness-driven global allocation. No live intervals, no coloring or
linear scan, no spill decisions — the frame slot is always live, which is why every def
still stores and why values die at joins the meet can't cross and at every call.

## the gap, measured

| date | vs | wall/cycles | insns | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-16 | clang | 1.84× | 3.6× | first systematic differential; IPC 3.5 vs 2.0 |
| 2026-07-17 | clang | 1.52× | 2.57× | six frame/cell levers in two days |
| 2026-07-18 | clang | ~1.32× | — | indexed loads, encoding shave, relaxation. ⚠ corpus+box changed after; not comparable forward |
| 2026-08-02 | gcc | 1.52×→1.34× | 2.78×→ | fresh 3-way re-base, then fleet-slots in one rung |
| 2026-08-03 | gcc | **1.30×** | 1.96× | int128 limbs, inlining honored, non-leaf slotting, cs pool, int homing; IPC 3.07 vs 2.17 |
| 2026-08-10 | clang | **1.18× cycles** | 1.71× | doc/moon-diff.md first fill; IPC 2.98 vs 2.05; shared-.text 1.75× |

The remaining excess is not idiom-shaped (that catalog closed 2026-08-02: cmp-$0, neg
dances, load-then-cmp all at parity). It is structural: slot traffic. At the fifth
differential ~22% of all static insns were rsp slot movs; only ~15% of reloads were
straight-line (peephole-reachable) — the rest cross branches and calls, which is exactly
the boundary the write-through vmap cannot cross.

## the physics — what prices a lever here

Learned by measuring, several times each; check a new lever against these before building:

* **This OoO desktop runs mooncc's code at IPC ~3.** An insn-count lever off the
  dependent path buys slack, not time: lea fusion, store-side addrfold copy-prop, and
  cmp-mem fusion all measured non-wins or regressions and were reverted. What pays:
  removed WORK on dependent chains (loads, frames, cells), fetch density with no
  critical-path cost (imm8 encoding, branch relaxation), and killed branches.
* **cmp-mem serializes load→cmp→branch** — the split form lets the OoO engine hoist the
  load. It's a density lever only; this is why real compilers keep them split too.
* **Alignment aliases the BTB.** align-16 measured −4% and was reverted; dense unaligned
  packing wins on this frontend. Corollary: **single-layout wall/cycle deltas under ~4%
  are unresolvable** — bench pad variants (an inert `ai_layout_pad` fn, sweep its size,
  median per side). Five landed rungs had their cycle read overturned by the pad probe.
  Even dyn-insn counts wiggle (±0.05% seen); measure the pad spread before invoking it.
* **The ship gate is "pays somewhere, regresses nowhere."** The host hides removed work
  as slack; mooncc's in-order targets (teensy, rp2040) cannot. A wall-neutral insn cut
  with clean semantics lands.

## the open levers, ranked

1. **Array slots** — a fixed-size local array with constant indices is a register file
   wearing a bad disguise; an element gets no vmap pin, so every touch is load+store.
   Measured 23× on chacha20 vs 1.77× on scalar poly1305 (bench/ccbench.sh carries both
   rows); love.c's z-tray elementwise lane 4.8×. Worth more than every landed rung
   combined on its shape. Watch: chacha and poly should close TOGETHER toward poly's
   ratio.
2. **Registers as the source of truth** — the allocator leg proper: liveness over ir1,
   values surviving labels and calls, spill placement instead of write-through. Kills
   both the def-stores and the post-flush reloads (the ~22% bucket). The vmap, the JOIN
   meet, the cs pool and cskeep are its substrate; this is the step the peepholes cannot
   take (their reach measured exhausted 2026-08-04).
3. **Compare staging want-hints** — lvm_eq's residual rsp traffic is &&-chain compare
   staging (spush cells + r0), not splices; want-hints through the compare lanes, or the
   allocator leg subsumes it.
4. Recorded small residues: leaf sp-fn stldw coverage; a non-positional fallback home
   (mag_cmp's g1 loses its seat and stays slotted); cs-borrow park elision; params on cs
   regs (lvm_eq a/b); arm64 x19+ cspool (empty there today); register-binding splice
   depth (map_probe's &-decline); d128 params ("a wide arg: not carried"); variable
   index±k rebase; narrow cmp fusion (632 sites, needs cc-aware licensing); the
   3-address dance emission (encoder territory — the reverted lea-fusion physics, only
   density-neutral shapes need apply).

## the laws a new rung must hold

* **unframe is correctness, not optimization** — the glaze ABI rides Ip in rbp, so a
  framed fn that calls into the VM faults. Any op that can base on r4 joins a4base AND
  uoff (and deadst's scans); a raw op bars unframe at every splice site (emit named ops).
* **A new op names itself everywhere**: holo's x64-emitters row + ir-arity row, its ISA
  family in gen.l's tables, and its cs effect (cskeep refuses a dark op).
* **alsafe?** — an alias lives only where staging never writes: x64 all-but-r0-r3;
  a64/t32/rv only pool0 ∪ cspool. The ride license covers defs, not reads.
* **vmap hygiene** — pins are born only from pool regs; no pin is born during call-arg
  staging (the argseal) or inside a splice body; any lane that DISCARDS a cgexpr
  emission must vmflush (cgexpr is not pure under pins).
* **rgon-gate any mid-compile register consumer** — an ir1-visible bind flips
  lpick/payoff rankings unpriced (a fn can lose its tail jump); regen attempts only.
* **pears stops at the first body label** — a park's per-iteration reset wears the
  entry-home mov shape; renaming past a label erases it (the strpbrk miscompile;
  test_libc was the only catch).
* **cu0 stays in assignment order** (cs save offsets ride it); d128 stays out of
  homable?/vmap (the pair rides `'regw` seats only).
* a64 raw splices scratch r2/r3/r9/r15 ONLY — r10-r14 are homes.

## how to measure honestly

* Build twins from the repo root (the seat walk; a scratchpad mooncc can't link), same
  TU set, ccache off. Bench under LOVE_NO_IMAGE=1 on both sides, corpus as a FILE, or
  bake both — never mixed (a fresh worktree's cold image once read as −23% insns).
* After a gen.l edit: `make out/host/mooncc.image` FIRST (make test does not rebake it),
  then rebuild the moon objects; a bake that crashes leaves a poisoned image — restore
  love from a known-good copy and bake by hand.
* Interleave slot-alternating rounds; byte-cmp the binaries before believing a delta on
  a semantic no-op (⚠ a bake is never byte-stable and the embedded love-version hash
  differs across HEADs — compare offset sets or the .o). Real text is `objdump -h`
  .text, never size(1).
* Probe the verdict chain before theorizing: the sed-probe on a gen.l copy + the mooncc
  cat answers in minutes what disassembly matrices can't; the framed-set diff (objdump
  push-rbp per symbol, comm vs a twin) finds frame regressions; dump pre-fold IR via the
  in-process cc-parse/cgen-obj recipe. A probe's INPUT gets validated before its verdict
  is believed.
