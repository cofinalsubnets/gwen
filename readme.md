# lisa
LISt Action

## build / install
are you on linux? `make` will probably work. otherwise, see
`Makefile` for the suggested compiler flags.

## usage

lisa is alive, so unstable. usage is schemelike, but
relaxed. `#f` = `()` = `0`. special forms have short
names and use less parentheses. pairs are immutable and
eagerly cons'd, so acyclic. improper list literals are
absent.

special form examples compared to scheme:

| scheme                     | lisa        |
|----------------------------|-------------|
|`(begin a b)`               |`(, a b)`    |
|`(lambda - #f)`             |`(\)`        |
|`(lambda - a)`              |`(\ a)`      |
|`(lambda (a) b)`            |`(\ a b)`    |
|`(lambda (a b) c)`          |`(\ a b c)`  |
|`(lambda (a . b) c)`        |`(\ a b . c)`|
|`(begin (define a b) a)`    |`(: a b)`    |
|`(begin (define a b) c)`    |`(: a b c)`  |
|`(cond (a b) (#t #f))`      |`(? a b)`    |
|`(cond (a b) (#t c))`       |`(? a b c)`  |
|`(cond (a b) (c d) (#t #f))`|`(? a b c d)`|

etc.

## code examples

### a quine
```lisp
((\ - (L - (L ` -))) '(\ - (L - (L ` -))))
```

### hyperoperation sequence
```lisp
(: (hy x n y) ( ? (~ n) (+ x y) (~ y) 1
 (hy x (- n 1) (hy x n (- y 1)))))
```

### church numerals

church numerals display natural numbers as elements of an abelian
monoid `N = 0 + succ N`. hyperoperations appear as complexity
classes of self-actions of `N` via `M`, the monoid of endomorphisms on
`N` generated by `succ`. by construction, `M` is `N`'s image under
`succ`, and forms a second abelian monoid under `1 = succ 0`. the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic maps `N` onto `M` through the
factorizing homomorphism `f` whose kernel is `{0, 1}`.

this paints a dramatic picture. the polymorphism `f` floods `N`; the
receding waters reveal `M`, in privation of its former identity, yet
holding a second within its nature, as if by chance. a rainbow appears:
a bridge back to the origin made out of `M`'s infinite generators. the
bridge is endless, and the toll to pass is unlimited attention paid to
the smeared image we wish to correct.

more concretely, the task (not attempted here) is to construct a point
at infinity in adelic space, representing a quantity `z` congruent to 0
modulo everything. each `p` is now the neutral element of a new monoid
`Np = p + Np ^ z`. since by construction `a ^ b = b a`, this means `p` and
`z` assume the place of 0 and `succ` in the original equation for `N`.
the impression received is that primes are significant among integers
because of a property they share with 0.

TODO:
- construct subtraction and division in `N`
- clarify the ontological status of inverse elements
- describe the structure of each `Np`. how does it differ from `N`?
- what, if anything, is the meaning of `succ z`? `z z`?
- describe `z` and `N` in relation to other infinite objects
- anything going on up there in the rest of the the hyperoperations?

```lisp
(:
 ; zero is the constant function at the identity function
 zero (\ (\ - -))
 ; a successor applies its argument then yields to its predecessor
 (((succ f) g) h) ((f g) (g h))

 one (succ zero) ; \ f -> f = identity
 two (succ one) ; \ f -> f . f = square
 three (succ two) ; \ f -> f . f . f = cube 

 ; binary operations follow from succ:
 ((add g) f)         ; the monoid on N
  ((f succ) g)       ; \ g f x -> f x . g x
 ((mul g) f)         ; the monoid on End(N)
  ((f (add g)) zero) ; \ g f x -> f (g x)

 ; the rest are iterations of the "up arrow" map:
 (((up op) g) f) ((f (op g)) one)
 ; these operations fail to be abelian or even associative,
 ; which makes the compatibility of the first two seem
 ; miraculous and special.
 pow (up mul) ; exponentiation ; \ f -> f = one ; this also feels significant
 tet (up pow) ; tetration, etc.
